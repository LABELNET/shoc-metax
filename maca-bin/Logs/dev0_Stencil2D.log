Running single precision test

Performing stencil operation on host for later comparison with CUDA output
Depending on host capabilities, this may take a while.
Performing 1 warmup passes...done.

Performing stencil operation on chosen device, 10 passes.
Depending on chosen device, this may take a while.
At the end of each pass the number of validation
errors observed will be printed to the standard output.
pass 0: 0 validation errors
pass 1: 0 validation errors
pass 2: 0 validation errors
pass 3: 0 validation errors
pass 4: 0 validation errors
pass 5: 0 validation errors
pass 6: 0 validation errors
pass 7: 0 validation errors
pass 8: 0 validation errors
pass 9: 0 validation errors
